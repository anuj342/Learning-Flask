# Learning-Flask
This repository is my journey of learning Flask, the lightweight Python web framework, by building real projects.

## Day 1
On day 1, I learnt about basic routing, URL creation, syntaxes, importing modules etc. As i advanced ahead and decided to learn as much as possible, I learnt to create my first database using SQlAlchemy and SQLite.
