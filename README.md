# Learning-Flask
This repository is my journey of learning Flask, the lightweight Python web framework, by building real projects.

## Day 1
On day 1, I learnt about basic routing, URL creation, syntaxes, importing modules etc. As i advanced ahead and decided to learn as much as possible, I learnt to create my first database using SQlAlchemy and SQLite.

## Day 2
On day 2, I learned about creating a form function, adding inputs to my website, storing and displaying the inputs, deleting and updating them. I created a css file to align all the elements to make my page structured.

## Day 3
On day 3, I started to learn front-end stack such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. Made a simple website and will later integrate in a full stack project.
